# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-
This project detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using a live webcam feed, and displays the result in a web interface built with Flask. It uses deep learning (CNN model) for classification and OpenCV Haar Cascade for real-time face detection

# Dataset 
The data used can be downloaded through this [link](https://data-flair.training/blogs/download-face-mask-data/)
The dataset consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.
It is an excellent dataset for people who want to try learning techniques of deep learning for face mask detection
